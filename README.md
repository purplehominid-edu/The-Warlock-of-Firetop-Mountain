# The-Warlock-of-Firetop-Mountain
The original ‘Warlock of Firetop Mountain’ was first published in 1982 as a single-player adventure game book written by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone and illustrated by Russ Nicholson. The game book inspired two direct sequels and five novels as well as being adapted into a board and video game. The original game book distinguished itself by featuring a fantasy role-playing element where the reader becomes the hero. The ‘Warlock of Firetop Mountain’ is a fantasy scenario involving a dungeon quest during which the reader searches for the “untold wealth of treasure" hidden and guarded by a powerful Warlock. As the adventurer, the player explores the cavernous dungeons beneath Firetop Mountain. At the start of the quest, the player is told by the inhabitants of a nearby village that the treasure is stored in a chest secured with two locks and that the keys are guarded by various creatures. The hero must navigate the dungeons beneath Firetop Mountain, battle monsters, locate the keys and unlock the chest.
